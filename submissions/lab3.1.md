# Lab 3.1 — Submission

## Task 1: SSH Commit Signing

### Local configuration
- `git config --global gpg.format` →  ssh
- `git config --global user.signingkey` →  /Users/tien.p.nguyen/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
- `git config --global commit.gpgsign` → true

### Local verification
Output of `git log --show-signature -1`:
Good "git" signature for nptkenny@gmail.com with ED25519 key [fingerprint redacted]
Author: Kenny <nptkenny@gmail.com>

    test: first signed commit

### GitHub verification
- Direct link to your most recent commit on GitHub: https://github.com/nptkenny12/devsecops-lab/commit/343e22170afc20a7ee384ce9ab5ccc7d380bbd1f
- Screenshot of the Verified badge: 
### Evidence

![Verified badge](screenshots/lab3.1-verified.png)

### One-paragraph reflection (2-3 sentences)

A forged-author commit could make it appear that a trusted developer introduced a malicious change, allowing the attacker to deny responsibility and complicating incident investigation. The Verified badge makes the attack visible by confirming whether the commit was signed with a key linked to the claimed GitHub identity; an unsigned or unverified commit would raise suspicion.

## Task 2: Pre-commit + gitleaks

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.30.1
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-private-key
      - id: check-added-large-files
```
### `pre-commit install` output

```text
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### The blocked commit

```text

- [x] Task 1 — SSH signing configured + Verified badge on commit
- [x] Task 2 — .pre-commit-config.yaml + gitleaks demonstrably blocking
